I'm Martin TOUZOT, a software developper :computer: working in the image processing field.

In my free time, when I'm not watching a **movie** :clapper: at the [Grand Rex](https://www.legrandrex.com/) and with no **novels** :books: to read, I love :
* playing **board games** :game_die: with friends
* **running** :runner: to take on personal challenges (10km, half-marathon, marathon,...)
* **traveling** :steam_locomotive: in France or outer world
* learning **guitar** :guitar: (or **ukulele**)
* **making** :construction_worker: my DIY projects come alive
* **streaming** :red_circle: my projects on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mt_mak3r) _when I can_
